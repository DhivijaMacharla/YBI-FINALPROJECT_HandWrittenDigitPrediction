# Handwritten Digit Classification with Random Forest

This project demonstrates the classification of handwritten digits using the Random Forest algorithm. The dataset used is the popular `digits` dataset from the `sklearn` library.


## Introduction

The goal of this project is to classify images of handwritten digits (0-9) using a Random Forest classifier. The dataset consists of 8x8 pixel images of digits.
